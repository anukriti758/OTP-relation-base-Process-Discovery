Object Type Perspective-Based Process Discovery
This module provides functionality to discover process models for each object type perspective in an Object-Centric Event Log (OCEL). It is particularly useful in Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) to analyze how different object types (e.g., orders, items, packages) participate in events and influence control-flow behavior
